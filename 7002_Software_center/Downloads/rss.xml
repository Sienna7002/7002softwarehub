      <description>A simple program written in AppleScript that gives detailed information about your Mac. Ever realised that the Monterey &amp;quot;About This Mac&amp;quot; was lackluster. Which was made even more lackluster in macOS Ventura. Well this simple little applet which is easily configurable using the pre-installed Script Editor is for you. I hope everyone who uses this little application enjoys it!</description>
